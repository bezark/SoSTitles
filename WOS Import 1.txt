Strip the cities of brick.*Dismantle them.
Strip out the wires*and cover the land with grass.
- Force chrome and aluminum back into the earth.*- Cancel all flights from the international airport . . .
. . . and people the sky with angels.
- Erase the Saturday carpark from the marketplace.*- Shatter the printing press.
- Make each new book a precious object, written on skin.*- Rub out the white lines.
Make way for the wild primrose*and slow torture of criminals.
Fade out the living:*snap back the dead to life.
The woman?
Was married age fourteen.
Can’t write. Not taught to read.*Grey-eyed. Intelligent. No children.
And the man?
The man is her husband and protector.
Calm. Powerful.*Addicted to purity and violence.
Stand here. Look.*My house is perfect.
At night, stars wheel over my vines*according to the strict mechanism of the world.
And day by day – says the Protector – fruit trees,*blue heads of iris, pink cups of eglantine turn to the sun.
I own the fields:*I own everyone in them.
Every beech, each visible oak,*is as much my property as my dog, my millstream . . .
. . . or my wife’s body, her still and obedient body . . .
. . . is my property.
Make me a book.
Fill it with illumination.
Paint me the life to come.*Paint deeds of angels.
Show me graves opening,*the damned shoveled into ovens, and the just . . .
. . . us, my family, the pure and just,*show us in our rightful place.
Show us in Paradise.
- A book costs money, says the Boy.*- I’ll give you money.
- A book needs long days of light.*- I’ll give you money. I’ll give you light.
But first: show me proof.
The Boy takes from his satchel*an illuminated page.
This – says the Boy –*shows a Work of Mercy.
Here, look, three men, all starving:*two wheeling on this cart the third.
And here’s a rich man – see him? -*in a red satin coat lined with green.
In his face, round his eyes, see his expression*as he offers the three sick men wine and bread.
Not just kind – explains the Boy –*kind is too easy  – but merciful.
Not just kind, but merciful.
Merciful.
No! No! says the woman.
Nobody here starves.*No! Nobody here begs.
- But the Protector takes the page gently to the window . . .*- What does this Boy want?
- . . . looks deeper and deeper into the page . . .*- What does this thing, this picture, mean?
. . . recognizes in the rich and merciful painted man*himself. Says to his wife:
His talent’s clear. I’m satisfied.*You will welcome him into our house.
- Stone the Jew: make him wear yellow.*- Crusade against the Moslem.
Map out new territory with blood.
- Invent the world.*- In seven days invent the whole world.
- Invent sun . . .*- In a single day, moon, man.
Invent man and drown him.
- Good.*- Burn him alive.
- Good.*- Bulldoze him screaming into a pit.
- Invent a woman.*- Invent her.
- Take her naked out of the toy-box. Play house with her.*- Strip her. Dress her. Strip her again. Play families.
Play birth and death.
Blame her for everything.
- Blame her mouth. Blame her intelligence.*- Tint her flesh with a soft brush.
Make her curious.
The woman takes off her shoes,*steps through a stone slit . . .
. . . turns up the spiral stairs,*pads into the writing room, where the Boy . . .
. . . ah, yes, look . . .
. . . the Boy bends over a new page.
What is it she feels*between her bare feet and the wood floor?
Grit.
What do you want,*says the Boy.
- To see, says the woman.*- See what?
To see how a book is made.
What is that tree?
The Tree, says the Boy,*of Life.
- Ah. Odd.*- I invented it.
Ah. Yes.*And who is that woman?
Eve, says the Boy.
- Invented too?*- Yes, says the Boy, invented too.
She doesn’t look real,*laughs the woman.
That’s not how a woman looks.
You’re in my light,*says the Boy.
- Yes, in my light, too close . . .*- Oh? Too close in what way?
- Too close to the page. You’re in my light.*- Too close?
Too close.
What else can you invent?
Can you invent another woman,*says the woman . . .
. . . not this, but a woman who’s real,*a woman who can’t sleep . . 
. . . who keeps turning her white pillow over and over*from the hot side to the cold side . . .
. . . until the cold side’s hot?
- Can you invent that?*- What is it you mean – says the Boy.
- And, if the woman said – says the woman.*- If the woman said what – says the Boy.
What if you invented a woman*who said she couldn’t sleep . . .
. . . who said that her heart split and shook*at the sight of a . . .
. . . of a boy, the way light in a bowl of water*splits and shakes on a garden wall . . .
. . . who said that her grey eyes,*at the sight of a boy, turn black . . .
- What boy?*- . . . with love.
- You can decide what boy. You can decide what love.*- What love?
Invent her.*Invent the woman you want.
When you know the color of her eyes,*the length of her hair, the precise music of her voice . . .
. . . when you’ve quickened her pulse, entered her mind,*tightened her skin over her back . . .
. . . when you have invented and painted*that exact woman . . .
. . . come, come to me, show her to me.
I’ll tell you if she’s real.
The Archer appears in the sky:*the grapes are picked and crushed.
The Protector inhales the wine, watches hot blood*from a pig’s throat splatter the snow at the visitors’ feet . . .
. . . thinks: my wife has changed, won’t eat,*won’t speak to me, resents and avoids the Boy . . .
- How are you – says Marie.*- . . . turns away from me in bed, pretends to be sleeping.
- How is my sister, says Marie.*- . . . but in the dark . . .
. . . her eyes are wide open, and all night I hear*her eyelashes scrape the pillow, click, click, like an insect.
How is my sister?
My wife?
My wife is well. Sweet and clean.*Soft, still, obedient.
And your house?
Increasing in value daily.
- Nobody starves. Everyone freely obeys.*- And the book?
- Yes, how’s the book? Still eating money?*- The book . . .
The book will be magnificent.
The Boy works with azurite and gold.
Both Boy and book are faultless.
- Ah. Faultless.*- The Boy, yes, is faultless.
- The Boy is faultless?*- Don’t, Marie.
- The Boy is, yes, is faultless.*- What kind of man pays to keep a boy like that in his house?
Be quiet, Marie.
Listen to me:*I love the Boy.
What kind of man sits a stranger . . .
- . . . a stranger next to his own wife at his own table?*- Anybody who faults the Boy faults me.
- Do not fault the book, John.*- Nobody is faultless.
- Nobody on this earth is faultless.*- No not fault the Boy, Marie . . .
. . . you will not pass the black dog at my gate.
Woman . . . alone . . .
Night.*Her visitors?
Gone. Her husband?*Sleeping in front of the kitchen fire.
What can she hear inside of her?*Her own voice.
What does the voice want?*To wind and to wind itself around another.
- Who does she catch click shut the black rectangle of the door?*- Him, the Boy.
- What do you want – says the woman.*- To show you the page – says the Boy.
- Here.*- It’s dark.
Then concentrate.
This – says the Boy – shows a house in winter.
Here . . . look . . . white stars . . . Orion . . .*And in this wide, blank space, the moon.
See how I’ve lifted the roof*like a jewel-box lid.
Inside’s the woman . . . see her?*Unable to sleep.
Buried in the hot white pillow,*her head feels heavy like stone.
Round her legs, round her arms,*I’ve twisted a lead-white sheet like a living person . . .
. . . and tightened her skin,*darkened her veins with blood.
This is the woman’s picture.*Now you must tell me whether it’s real.
It’s dark.
Then look more closely.
What color are her eyes?
Grey . . . turning black . . .*like my eyes now.
Like yours now.
And her hair?*Pay attention.
- Dark, damp, heavy . . . the weight of mine.*- Of your hair now.
- And her mind? I’ve given her your mind, skin, mouth . . .*- You’ve given her my mind, skin, mouth, voice . . . 
. . . drawn its exact music.
And here . . .*Here, under the bone . . .
In the hot space between her ribs . . .
- I’ve painted the woman’s heart.*- No! Not “the woman.” 
I am Agnès.*My name’s Agnès.
What use to me is a picture?*A picture – says Agnès – is nothing.
- Love’s not a picture.*- Agnès . . .
Love is an act.
People are saying,*saying the book eats TIME.
- Saying the book eats what?*- CORN. RENT.
Say it’s a crow eating the seed, making the people*TALK . . . LAUGH . . . STARVE.
Not just the book – say that the Boy –*DRAWS FROM LIFE.
Say there’s a page where the skin never dries –*SKIN STAYS DAMP.
- Wet like a woman’s mouth . . .*- Wet like the white part of an egg . . .
- Where a woman screams, shrieks like a fox . . .*- Licking her lips, flicking her tongue . . .
- In the night, in a secret bed.*- Gripping the Boy in a secret bed.
1What kind of a man*WILL NOT SEE?
The Protector wakes up,*feels in the half-light . . .
. . . for the reassurance of a human body . . .
. . . puts out his hand to be reassured by a human body . . .
Feels for his wife.*Where is she?
Here – smiles Agnès – I’m here by the window.
You were thrashing in your sleep. Why?
What is it you’re watching?
Nothing. Sunrise.*Plum trees flowering.
And smoke . . .*Why that black smoke in May?
- We’re burning villages.*- Ah. Why?
- To protect the family.*- Ah. Yes. Good. From what?
- Don’t look.*- And in the meadow, I saw a guard reach into the buttercups . . .
- Don’t look.*- . . . to pick up a baby, to pick it up, how odd . . .
. . . on the point of a stick.
And I, I saw the Boy out riding into the wood*like a picture out of his own book.
Touch me.
Kiss me.
Take my head in your hands.
- Don’t be a child, Agnès.*- Grip my hair in your fist. Yes.
Put your fingers in my mouth. Yes.*Your tongue into my mouth now. Yes.
Kiss me. Yes.*Kiss me now.
Only a child, Agnès, asks for a kiss.
I’m not a child.
- No pure woman asks for a kiss.*- I’m not a child. Don’t . . .
- No clean woman asks to be touched.*- Don’t call me a child.
- You are. You are a child, Agnès. Say it.*- Don’t call me a child.
- I refuse to be called a child.*- I said to you . . .
Say it. You will say to me*“I am a child.”
- Ask him what I am.*- Say, “I am a child,” Agnès.
Go to the wood.*Ask him.
Ask who?
The one who writes on skin.
Ask him what I am, the Boy.
He finds the Boy sitting against a tree,*looking at his own reflection in the blade of a knife.
Lovesick, thinks the Protector . . .
. . . easy to strangle, like a girl.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.*- What is it you’re looking at?
Nothing, says the Boy,*thumbing the knife.
Thinking about?
I’m thinking that when this wood and this light*are cut through by eight lanes of poured concrete . . .
. . . I’m thinking that the two of us and everyone we love . . .
. . . everyone will have been dead for a thousand years.
- The future . . . the future’s easy.*- A thousand years.
Tell me about now.
Now there’s just one slit*of pink light cut in the sky.
Tell me about now.
Now there’s just you, me and a knife.
Tell me about now.
Who is this woman? –*The one they say …
- I thought you trusted me.*- Taunt me and say screams out from a secret page . . .
- I thought you loved me . . .*- And sweats with you in a secret bed?
- . . . and protected me?*- What is her name? What is this woman’s name?
Is it Agnès?
- Not Agnès, no . . .*- Is what? Her name is what?
- No, Marie, her name’s Marie.*- Her name is what?
Marie: her sister.*Look at her.
She came to me.
- I’m bored.*- She was bored.
- I want to be Venus.*- She wanted to be Venus.
I want to be Venus.*Put me in the book. Illuminate me.
- AH! THAT HURTS!*- Sorry.
Then she wanted to be an angel.
- Make me an angel.*- She wanted . . .
- Give me power. I want . . .*- She wanted to crank the universe round on its axis.
I want to control the universe.
- Her marriage was banal.*- How do I look?       - We’re late.
THE GET ME MY SHOES!
- She longed for excitement.*- NOT THOSE! THE RED ONES!
- Feed me pomegranates and soft-cooked eggs.*- She volunteered to be Greed and Luxury.
Roast meat for me and drown me in wine and cream.*Wash me in goat milk.
- Strip me . . . dress me . . . strip me again.*- I don’t want to hear. I don’t want to know.
- Toss me naked into the toy-box.*- She was happy to let me draw from life . . .
- Draw my mouth as a scarlet thread.*- Let’s go, Marie. 
- Shame me. Chain me. Drag me to hell.*- We’re late. We’re going to be late. Let’s go.
- Shut me in eternal darkness with the devil.*- We’re going to be late. Let’s go.
I’M READY!
And her husband?
- Was complicit.*- Is this the truth?
Oh yes, believe me, it’s the truth.
And since this is what the man so much needed to believe,*so he, the man, this man, believed it.
And that same evening tells his wife . . . entertains her . . .*reveals . . . ha! . . . how . . . secretly the Boy enjoys . . . guess!
. . . that whore, her sister. Yes! And how that other man, *the fool, the husband – smiles the Protector – is complicit.
Agnès puts on her shoes . . .
. . . steps through the stone slit . . .
. . . turns up the stone stairs, slips into the writing room . . .
. . . where the Boy, him . . .
. . . yes, the liar, look, lifts his head.
Why are you crying?
You lied to me.
In what way lied?
All night your voice in my head*wound itself round and around and around my sister.
Her mouth fastened to yours in a bad dream,*and her hair stuck . . .
. . . stuck like gold leaf to your skin in a bad dream*and covered your eyes.
What dream?
My sister . . . you … the liar . . .*you and my sister. 
I lied for you, not to you.
Prove it.
- I lied to protect you.*- Protect . . .
To protect me or to protect yourself?
This isn’t true.
Prove it. Let him see.*Show him us.
Show him us how?
Or do you love him too?
Do you fasten your mouth to his mouth too and bite,*bite on his lip like you bite on mine?
What is it – says the Boy –*you want from me?
While the dead heap up in the meadow,*while human beings burn in the marketplace . . .
. . . make me a new page.
Push our love into that man’s eye*like a hot needle.
Blind him,*blind him with it.
Make him . . .
. . . cry blood.
- Here are your enemies, lined up on a gibbet.*- Hanging . . . excellent . . . like Judas.
- A vine-hook cutting a traitor’s throat.*- Yes, yes. And who are these?
These naked boys have dug their own graves.
They’re waiting in the orchard to be shot.
And what are these streaks of light?
A night bombardment:*Gomorrah – see it? – being turned to dust.
Now show me Paradise.
- An aquamarine flash . . . streets running with human fat . . .*- I see it, but show me Paradise.
- A carmine flame licking a field of wheat . . .*- I SAID NOW SHOW ME PARADISE.
Paradise?*But this is Paradise.
Here is your mill and here are your cherry trees.
Here’s . . . look . . . Marie shopping at the shopping mall*and John at the airport collecting air miles.
- This is Paradise. These are its concrete walls.*- If this is Paradise . . .
- And here, with a diamond skull, is the black dog at its gate.*- If this is Paradise – says Agnès – 
Here . . . here . . .
- Then where is Hell?*- Here – smiles the Boy – it’s on this secret page.
Where are the pictures?
They’re here: I’ve painted them with words.
- What words?*- Read them.
Read? Read? How can a woman read?*What words? Is this a word?
- Or this? This?*- The book is finished.
Where does a word end and another word begin?
- My work – smiles the Boy – is done.*- Where? Where are the pictures?
What? What use to a woman is a word?
Mouth . . . see it . . . mouth . . .*– writes the Boy.
Heart, hair, mouth, nail, hand, skin, blood, her neck –*writes the Boy – of amethyst …
Her long white back,*even the gold-flecked iris of her eye . . .
. . . each part of her body – writes the Boy – 
She has offered and has used for her own pleasure.
Like the man – writes the Boy – 
Like the man who bends down the branch in summer*to cut the most high-up flower – writes the Boy – 
I have reached up for her love*and have bent her willingly to the ground.
And at her own invitation,*her own invitation – writes the Boy – 
We have used and used and used*have used each other as – writes the Boy . . .
. . . pornography.
This is what the woman, what Agnès,*what your wife, your property – writes the Boy – 
. . . asks me to say to you.
Read it, oh read it again.
- Keep away.*- And show me, please show me . . .
- I want to see.*- Cover your arms.
Cover your face and hair.
Stitch shut your lips before your pink flicking tongue*snakes back into my mouth the way it burrowed into his.
NOW KEEP AWAY FROM ME.
Please let me see the word for love.
Set the earth spinning.*Fill it with iron and stone.
- Make a man out of dust.*- Good.
- Prop him naked on two stick legs.*- Good.
- Prop him tottering next to a tree.*- Good.
Tempt him, taunt him, clothe him,*spit him out.
Expel him from joy*with a lacerating whip.
- Make him sweat, cry, scratch at the earth’s crust.*- Make him jealous.
Make each man ashamed . . .
. . . ashamed to be human.
Put voices into his mind.
Confront the Boy – says one –*follow him into the wood.
No – says another voice –*be wise, be calm, be merciful.
Take his hair in your fist – says the third –*pull back his head for a kiss.
And as you are cutting one long clean incision*through the bone, examine your own portrait . . .
. . . in the glass-black mirror of his eyes.
Woman and her Protector . . .
Night. A room.
A balcony. A long white table.
What has he placed in front of her?
A silver dish.
What does she lift from the silver dish?*I said, what does she lift from the silver dish?
The warm round silver lid.
What does the woman do now?
- I said, what does the woman do now?*- I’m not that woman. I’m Agnès.
- Eats. The woman eats.*- Good. Say it.
What makes the woman eat?
- I said, what makes the woman eat?*- Hunger. Appetite. Her curiosity.
No: her obedience. Her obedience.*Say it. I need you to say it.
- Her obedience now makes her eat.*- Her obedience to her husband. That is correct.
How does it taste – says the man.
Good, she says – salt and sweet.
Why?
- Good?*- Yes, she says – good, she says – salt, strange and sweet.
Why?
- Good? How is it good?*- Sweet as my own milk, yes, good . . .
- But salt as my own tears. Why?*- Good? How is it good?
- What has my husband, my Protector, given me to eat?*- His heart, Agnès.
- What heart?*- His heart – the Boy – 
- No.*- His heart – the Boy – 
- No, nothing, nothing you can do . . .*- His heart, his heart, the Boy, his heart . . .
Nothing I ever eat, nothing I drink,*will ever take the taste of that Boy’s heart out of this body.
No force you use, nothing you forbid, can take away*the pictures that Boy’s hands draw on this skin.
He can unfold the tight green bud, unwrap the tree,*darken the wood, lighten the sky, blacken the dust with rain.
Each mark he makes on me is good,*each color clear.
Crush. Burn. Break. Tear.
Put out my eyes. Hang. Drown. Stone. Stab.*Cut out my tongue.
Nothing, not if you strip me to the bone with acid,*will ever take the taste of that Boy’s heart out of this mouth.
This – says the Angel –*shows the Woman Falling.
Here, look, the man takes a knife . . .
But the woman’s quicker, and jumps.
See how her body has dropped from the balcony,*how I pause her mid-fall at the exact center of the page.
Here in the night sky, see them, stars*hold in a bright web her black silhouette on blue.
As she drops from the house, three small angels, look,*are watching her calmly from the margin.
In their face, in their eyes, see their cold fascination*with human disaster . . .
. . . as they turn from the fallen woman . . .
. . . to where the white lines of the Saturday carpark*cover the heaped-up dead.
