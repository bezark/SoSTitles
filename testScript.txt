MARTHA: Mm mmmmm mmmm
Hmmmmm
Hush
Mmmm
Hush hush

MARTHA: Go away
Shoo. 

MARTHA: No don’t do that!
I wanted that! 

MARTHA: Well that’s fresh 
You back up now
Go on shoo.

MARTHA: Help.
Help!
Please, help!

WOMAN: What’s happening?!

MARTHA: The thing!
Has the knife!
 
WOMAN: The knife?

MARTHA: Look!

MARTHA points at the knife. 

WOMAN: Your robe’s on the floor.

MARTHA: They pulled it off me!

WOMAN: Did you get hot?

MARTHA: There are things in here! 

WOMAN/WINNIE: Holy jeez mom.

WOMAN/WINNIE: I’m your daughter, mom. 

MARTHA: I don’t think so. 

WOMAN/WINNIE: I’m your daughter, Winnie, and here’s your granddaughter. 

MARTHA: I don’t think so. 

WINNIE: I’m your daughter. 

MARTHA: You have the wrong look. 

WINNIE: I look like you because I’m your daughter. I look just like you mom. 

MARTHA: Well you just go on saying that. 

WINNIE: Well I will because it’s true.  

WINNIE: Mom it’s me. 

MARTHA: A boy in college
He had your look…

WINNIE: Do you remember that sometimes you can’t remember me? 

MARTHA: I had relations with this boy 
Don’t tell your father.

WINNIE: Come on mom let’s go. 

MARTHA: Where?

WINNIE: To spend a nice day 
As a family.

MARTHA: Will I see your father?

WINNIE: (gently) No. 

MARTHA: (almost remembering) Oh wait now

MARTHA: (reading) Barry died
It was breakfast 
He fell forward 
Onto his plate
I called the ambulance
I was holding his hand
He struggled to breath at the end but not too much pain
In hospital he was pronounced dead of a heart attack

WINNIE: Will you come with me now, mom?

MARTHA: I need my coat. 

WINNIE: No you don’t it’s hot out there.

MARTHA looks up at the snow falling. 
It falls on her face. 

WINNIE: Mom? 


DANNY: You think I’m demented—

IRA: No. 

DANNY: Because I couldn’t find where I parked my car. 

IRA: It’s parked on your street. 
You called me 
You said
I can’t find my car! 

DANNY: There’s ice in my driveway—

IRA: I drove over: your car is parked in front of your house—

DANNY: That’s not true!  
It’s down the street!

IRA: I could see it from your house. 

DANNY: There are trees—

IRA: Mom. 

DANNY: —trees blocking, yes there are! 

IRA: Mom I could see it. 

DANNY: [[[I didn’t look down the street!]]]
[[[I looked in the driveway!]]]
I looked where my car should be and:
No car!
I forgot about the ice and I didn’t look!

IRA: Mom 
Please

DANNY: Ira I’m fine! 

IRA: Please would you do a test?

Beat. 

IRA: It’s a simple test
Please 
Two minutes.

DANNY: Good
Let’s do a test
Good idea.

He pulls out a piece of paper. 

IRA: How many of these nouns can you remember. Horse. Tractor. Boat. Moon. Sofa. Toothbrush.  Flower. Face. Coffee. Table. 

Beat. 

DANNY: I used to boat. 

IRA: And

DANNY: And
Car? 

IRA: Car. 

DANNY: Yes.  

IRA: Any others?

DANNY: I’m thinking. 

Beat. 

IRA: Horse. Tractor. Boat. Moon. Sofa. Toothbrush.  Flower. Face. Coffee. Table. 

DANNY: Table. 

IRA: Any others?

Long agonized silence. 
Finally IRA hangs his head. 
His shoulders shake.

DANNY: Don’t cry. 

IRA: I’m sorry. 

DANNY: I am a capable 
I am a fully capable
A fully 

IRA: I’m so sorry mom.  

DANNY turns towards the audience. 
As she does, the old age home assembles around her and the ELDER CHORUS wander in.  
So does MARTHA. 
IRA remains nearby, hovering, uncertain what to do or how to help.

DANNY: (half to herself) I don’t understand
I don’t
It doesn’t 

IRA: I’m sorry.

DANNY: And you knew?
You thought I was going 
Downhill?
You knew?

IRA looks away. 

DANNY: But I follow the stock market
I do my taxes
I publish papers in scientific journals
I play the piano
I remember all the names of my neighbors 
I remember all the names of my neighbors’ dogs I 
Go to my stupid doctor’s appointments to make sure I stay 
Healthy 
I 
Sit on the board of my local women’s shelter I don’t 
I’m
I’m 
I forget things but
I put salt in my tea and I
Forgot 
The time of Jeannie’s birthday party 
And I know I wrote down juice instead of milk in a note to my 
But I still remember the Latin I learned in high school
I remember the catechism
I remember the way you looked when you were born Ira I remember it 
And my first house 
And my first friend

Transition.








Scene Three. 

The Alzheimer’s home comes into focus. 
DANNY is now speaking to the audience/ to an administrator at the Alzheimer’s home. 

DANNY: And I cleaned out my house
Bagged up my clothes
I chose which grandchild should get which piece of jewelry
I planned my funeral
And found a home for my dog
 When my condition worsens everything’s in order. 

ADMINISTRATOR: (to DANNY) You’re just so on top of this, aren’t you?

DANNY: I wanted to pick a place 
While I still can. 
.
ADMINISTRATOR: (to IRA) She’s very brave.

DANNY: No
No I’m not
It’s a nice facility but I don’t want to die in it 

ADMINISTRATOR: (gently, to ANNY) Well it isn’t over
You have years ahead of you of meaningful life

Beat. 

ADMINISTRATOR: I know it’s hard to see that right now—

DANNY: I’m still able, at this point, to understand what’s happening to me 
And that’s a crock of shit
In a year from now 
I won’t remember my son
He was pulled from my body and I won’t remember him— 

IRA: Mom—

DANNY: (to the administrator) I won’t remember my own face I’ll look in the mirror and have no idea who it is—  

IRA: Mom—

DANNY: (to IRA) This is happening to me
This is happening to me
I’m going to forget what a toilet’s for and GO IN MY PANTS
I’m not going to remember how to SWALLOW MY OWN SPIT
I won’t understand the papers I WROTE: I won’t understand MY OWN RESEARCH
The person I am will GO AWAY

IRA: I’m sorry
You’re right
You have a right to be
I’m sorry.

Beat. 

ADMINISTRATOR: (to IRA) She’s researched so much about all this! 

IRA: (flaring with anger himself now) Of course she has she’s a researcher!

DANNY: (to IRA) Ira. 

IRA: (to the ADMINISTRATOR) That was her job title!  

DANNY: (to the ADMINISTRATOR) Your facility is charming and
I can’t wait to move in and
Lose my fucking mind excuse the

Beat. 

ADMINISTRATOR: (gently, to DANNY) Danny I will say
It’s harder on those who 
Are independent
In control 
And prize the quickness of their minds.

DANNY gets up.

IRA: Where are you going?
Mom!

DANNY walks away and into the home, goes and watches the people wandering around or sitting and staring. 
MARTHA idles over to DANNY in her robe.

MARTHA: Moving in?

DANNY: Hopefully
Hopefully ha.
I 
Yeah
I yeah
I have
Turns out I have 
Alzheimers.

MARTHA: I do too
What a disgusting thing. 

DANNY: (moaning/keening with grief) Ahhhhhuhhhhhggggggggg

MARTHA: You get it out
Get it all out
Get your soul out.

MARTHA puts an arm around her. 
The two women stand there together. 

Transition. 





SCENE FOUR. 

MARTHA is in the kitchen. 
A storm. 
Wind blows.
The lights are dim. 
And perhaps large pieces of white cottony pollen blow in the air, caught in the wind. 

There are a few members of the ELDER CHORUS wandering around – perhaps they are naked in the storm.  We hear their chorus very faintly. 

ELDER CHORUS: (mumbling) If current medications can only delay the
And quality of life is impeded beyond the point of
And functional abilities are impaired beyond the point of
And investigational drugs are only, at this point, investigational
And plagues and tangles accelerate the speed of
And behavioral changes only increase the 
And dense deposits choke off the 
Which means the person I was
Which means 

Meanwhile, MARTHA crouches under the kitchen table, and rocks a little.  She’s only wearing underwear.

MARTHA: (desperate, to herself) I know I can find it
It’s in here
Mmm hmmmm
Mmmmm
Hush
There are matches here somewhere I 
Know there are matches
In this drawer 
I know I put them in here: where are they mm

ELDER CHORUS: (mumbling) If current medications can only delay the
And quality of life is impeded beyond the point of
And functional abilities are impaired beyond the point of
And investigational drugs are only, at this point, investigational
And plagues and tangles accelerate the speed of
And behavioral changes only increase the 
And dense deposits choke off the 
Which means the person I was
Which means 

MARTHA: (to herself) They are in here they are in here come on come on!
Please oh god please where are the matches. 

DANNY is there. 

DANNY: Are you okay down there?

MARTHA looks up at her in the dim lights.  

MARTHA: I’m scared
I’m scared I’m
The door
The back door’s open and I couldn’t find any
I’m scared that
I thought you were my daughter…? 
That makes no damn sense.
You know what: I don’t know why I’m scared

DANNY helps her up to her feet.
 
DANNY: Let’s get you up.

DANNY grabs a blanket and wraps it around her, tries to warm her up by putting her arms around MARTHA.

DANNY: You’re cold

MARTHA: Mmm not you 
You’re warm
Warm and Soft.

DANNY: Soft. 
Ha!

MARTHA: What’s wrong with soft?
Soft like an old couch: sink into her she’s soft. 

DANNY: You’re still cold where are your clothes?

MARTHA gently touches DANNY’S hair. 

MARTHA: Good eyes too
And a nice gray streak 
There’s a catcall for you
Mm you’re warm you’re warming me up 
Wait
Wait now  
That girl I remember her
A summer friend her skin was so warm from the sun and we lay on her porch and the 
Pollen

WINNIE comes in to the dim space, holding a flashlight.  
DANNY stands back.

WINNIE: (calling) Mom!
There you are!
I found you! 
I’ve missed you! 

MARTHA: No!

WINNIE: No?
No…what?

MARTHA: (panicked) No I don’t want you here! 

WINNIE: What do you mean?
We’re going out.

MARTHA: No I want to stay in my home.

WINNIE: I’m taking you home, mom.

MARTHA turns to DANNY.

MARTHA: (to DANNY, afraid) I don’t recognize the damn matches they’re in the damn drawer but I can’t 
Find them in the drawer 
Because my damn brain is broken
Damn it
And my daughter’s coming over and I can’t find my clothes and I can’t find my matches and the lights are out and I can’t find the fuse box because I can’t find the damn basement and
I don’t want to go into a home!

WINNIE: Mom 
No
You’re in the home
It already happened 
I’m going to take you to your house that you lived in for twenty-seven years
For a visit

MARTHA: No. 

WINNIE: Come on mom it’s okay!

But MARTHA clings to DANNY. 

MARTHA: No I don’t want her. 

WINNIE: Mom please
It’s okay
Mom
Stop holding onto that lady you’re hurting her.

MARTHA: (to WINNIE) No! 

DANNY: (to WINNIE) I don’t mind. 

MARTHA: (to WINNIe) No you back up!

WINNIE tries to pull MARTHA off of DANNY but MARTHA clings harder. 
WINNIE gives up and stops pulling on her. 
WINNIE wraps her arms around DANNY even more tightly. 

WINNIE: Mom?  

DANNY: (to MARTHA, trying to be comforting) It’s okay
It’s okay
You’re home.  

MARTHA looks up at DANNY, into her eyes.

MARTHA: I’m home. 

End scene. 




















SCENE FIVE. 

DANNY is in a room. It’s empty. Echoing. 
There is one elderly woman (played by an ELDER CHORUS MEMBER) nearby who speaks.

DANNY: (to herself) I am
I
I am
I

DANNY looks around, confused. 

ELDERLY WOMAN: Sparky. Sparky. Sparky-Spark. Sparky! 

DANNY: I came from
I 
Was walking 
Down a
Corridor…?
And now I’m 

ELDERLY WOMAN: Sparky. Sparky. Sparky-Spark. Sparky! 

DANNY: I
I’m 
I don’t recognize this
I don’t recognize any of this 
I don’t 
Know where I am
I don’t know where this is I need
Help I

DANNY starts to panic. 
MARTHA is there and sees DANNY, sees her panic and comes towards her.

DANNY: (to MARTHA) You!
I know you! 
Where am I?
Where is this?

MARTHA: I’m going to hold your hand.  

DANNY: Do you know where we are?

MARTHA: Sure I do
America
This is the what-dya-call-it 
The what-dya-call-it common room you recognize it now?

DANNY looks at MARTHA, then looks around. 
She tries to orient herself. 
Soon other people – the ELDER CHORUS among them – are in the home. 
They bring in with them furniture that suggests the common room – chairs, a wall-mounted television, board games etc. 
 
ELDERLY WOMAN: Sparky. Sparky. Sparky-Spark. Sparky!
Sparky. Sparky. Sparky-Spark. Sparky!

DANNY is distracted by the ELDERLY WOMAN calling “Sparky!”. 
MARTHA clocks it, and tries to explain:

MARTHA: She’s calling her dog
On the plus side she remembers its name

ELDERLY WOMAN: Sparky. Sparky. Sparky-Spark. Sparky!

DANNY: I’m scared one day I won’t find the bathroom

MARTHA: Oh you won’t
Happens to us all.

DANNY: Oh god
I’d rather be 
I’d rather
No I wouldn’t 
My son
I want to
See as much of his life as I can

MARTHA: I don’t mean to make you scared

DANNY: I’m scared 

MARTHA: Hush now dear
I’m here

MARTHA holds DANNY to her. 

DANNY: I’m sorry

MARTHA: No you cry you soak my shirt

MARTHA touches her hair. 

MARTHA:  That girl….
Soaked my shirt
And pollen?
Pollen in the air?
And that dress that showed your knees
Red lips like fruit
I was in love with this girl 
Or something like love I was only fifteen or so
And you wore those pink shoes and that dress that showed your knees and I had my hands in your pockets

DANNY: I 

MARTHA: I’m being fresh

DANNY: You
I don’t know you

MARTHA: Your house was grey
And tall trees with white flowers?
And you had hair that soft like the fur of something small like a bunny or a  

DANNY: I
I 
I don’t think so

MARTHA: Your house was grey mine was too

DANNY: I
I don’t
I don’t know
I can’t remember 
We moved around

MARTHA: You remember me. 

DANNY: I 
No I
You’ve got me confused

MARTHA: Your house was gray

DANNY: My house was
White or
Gray?
It’s 
I’m not that girl

MARTHA: Soft hair
Tall
Girlish laugh

DANNY: No.

MARTHA: Good eyes 

DANNY: You
No 
You don’t remember.

MARTHA: Mmmm mmmm hmmmm
Pollen in the
Love you
Love you so much. 

DANNY: No!
No no…

DANNY gets away from MARTHA. 

Perhaps by now there are large piece of cottony pollen floating in the air. MARTHA looks up at them. 

DANNY: (desperate, to herself) I know who I am
I know where I am
I can tie my shoes
I can feed myself
I can brush my teeth
I can put on my clothes
I can call my son 
I know his number
I know his name
I know my name
I know my dog’s name it’s
It’s 
It’s
Sparky.

And perhaps now DANNY looks up and sees the balls of pollen falling on them. She touches one of them. 

MARTHA: (to DANNY) Pollen
Pollen in the air.

DANNY frightened and confused, rocks.
Transition. 




SCENE SIX. 

IRA and WINNIE wait and wait in the reconstituted common room. Perhaps it is a sudden cold dose of naturalism?

IRA: You have a person in here?

WINNIE: My mother.

IRA: Mine too. 
Does she remember you?

WINNIE: Now and then. 

They half-smile.

WINNIE: There are worse things.

IRA: Like what?

They half smile.
Then WINNIE shrugs.

WINNIE: She’s had a good life.
A wild one even
Long nights 
Lot of hangovers
She’s loved
She’s not alone
This place is nice 
Nice enough
You seem scared

IRA shakes her head. 
He grapples and searches to find the right words.

IRA: She’s my mother
She’s 
Seen my whole life
She’s my
Mother
I’m scared to 
Lose her 
Or look into her eyes and 
See nothing 
Death before she’s dead
If my own mother doesn’t know me…? 
I’ll be alone.

Transition.



























SCENE SEVEN. 

We are in a blasted open surrealist landscape.
Perhaps there are pieces of furniture, as well as pieces of objects and detritus from the Alzheimer’s home.
Perhaps there is nothing that recognizable. 
MARTHA hums over the ELDER CHORUS.
MARTHA tries to find somewhere to sit down, but perhaps there is nowhere obvious. 

Perhaps compartments in the ground open up to reveal lights under their feet.
The ELDER CHORUS sing:

ELDER CHORUS: (mumbling, very low) 
If current medication can only delay the
And quality of life is impeded beyond the point of
And functional abilities are impaired beyond the point of
And investigational drugs are only, at this point, investigational
And plagues and tangles accelerate the speed of
And behavioral changes only increase the 
And dense deposits choke off the 
Which I do not like because my car’s my independence
Which indicates a rapid decline of

Simultaneous to the above, to drown it out: 

MARTHA: (overlapping with above) Mmm Mmmm Mmmmmmmmmm hmmmmm.
Mmmm
Hm
Pollen in the 
Mmmmm
My aching 
Hush
Mmmmmm
The summer girl mmmmm shut up.

DANNY comes on and stares, bewildered and panicked, at the broken-down landscape of the space. 
MARTHA goes up to her immediately, helps her navigate, touches her. 

DANNY: I 
I’m 
I don’t know where I am 

MARTHA: Soft

DANNY: I don’t
I don’t 
No I don’t

MARTHA: Soft like fur or
Something
Bunnies or silk

DANNY: I was trying to find the
I was
Trying to find
I’m I don’t
The bathroom or?
I’m gone I think

MARTHA: So much humour in your 
Mmmm hmmmm
Eyes
Soulful
That’s yours 
You still have that 
Same as before. 

DANNY: Do I?
I don’t think so
I don’t
I’m not
I’m lost I’m gone I’m lost again I’m gone I’m lost

MARTHA: No your eyes are the same 
When you were young too
You’re you

MARTHA reaches for her again. 

MARTHA: Let me
I’ll hold you
For comfort hush

DANNY shies away. 

DANNY: I don’t think
I don’t 

MARTHA: Here 
With me 
Hush dear.

Both MARTHA and DANNY hear the ELDER CHORUS. 

ELDER CHORUS: (mumbling, very low) 
If current medication can only delay the
And quality of life is impeded beyond the point of
And functional abilities are impaired beyond the point of
And investigational drugs are only, at this point, investigational
And plagues and tangles accelerate the speed of
And behavioral changes only increase the 
And dense deposits choke off the 
Which I do not like because my car’s my independence
Which indicates a rapid decline of

Simultaneous to the above:
Overlapping the above: 

MARTHA: (to DANNY) 
Mmm mmmm
Hmmmmm mmmm
Hush
It’s alright
Sometimes they go on and on like that 

DANNY lets herself be held, but is distracted by the ELDER CHORUS. 

MARTHA: Mmmm
Strange
I love you 
More than my 
My whole life I thought of 
Mmm Mmmm Mmmmmmmmmm hmmmmm.
Mmmm
I thought of you
Mm mm
You’re soft
Your eyes
On the porch lying back soaked and your skin

DANNY: Soft and warm
I could fall into you
Let go and
You’d be soft.

Time passes. 
In the background (or foreground), compartments in the ground open up. Lights pour out of them. Bunnies jump out of them. 

DANNY: You held my hand
We 
The sky
On swings
The birds are black
I covered my mouth
Pounding down the sidewalk and there’s my house
Your hands are sticky
Soft and warm
In my pocket

MARTHA: Mmmm
Hmmmmmm
Mmmm
Happy.

Time passes. 
Dirt shoveled. 

MARTHA:...mm…

DANNY: Lips
Red like fruit and
You say how my hair is soft and
You say how my eyes are
Soulful
So much humor in them

MARTHA:…

In the background (or foreground) the surrounding are shifting and shifting. 
Transition. 





















SCENE EIGHT. 

DANNY clings onto MARTHA, who is now comatose. 
The ADMINISTRATOR and IRA are there. 

ADMINISTRATOR: (to IRA) We found her in here
She won’t let go 
We don’t want to 
Disturb her
They seem so happy
Soon though
We have to move Martha.

IRA: The woman she’s holding is she…?

ADMINISTRATOR: Martha is dying.

IRA: (to DANNY) Mom?

DANNY: I’m the girl.

IRA: Mom?

DANNY: Pollen. 

IRA: It’s your son, Ira
Would you be able to 
Get up mom. 

DANNY: In the air. 

IRA: Please.

DANNY: I love you. 

IRA: And I love you
Mom, let me help you up?

DANNY: I’m home.
